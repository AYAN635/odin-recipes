    <p>
        The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily
        alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are
        the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of
            flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two
            cans of tomato paste.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the
            sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil
            leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into
            it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, sausage, onion, and garlic in the hot
            skillet until beef and sausage are browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease; transfer
            beef and sausage mixture to a large pot.</li>
        <li>Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, salt, Italian
            seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper into the beef and sausage mixture. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1
            hour.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer 1/3 of the noodles over the
            sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the
            ricotta cheese. Repeat layers twice more, ending with mozzarella cheese. Beat egg in a bowl; stir in
            remaining parsley. Pour over the top of the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 25 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes
            before serving.</li>
    </ol>
